  title: The History of APIs
  description: >-
    <p>History is everything.  Understanding where we have come from is critical
    to knowing where we are going. While pushing forward with the latest
    technology, it is always healthy to pause and take a look at that past--so
    let's take a look at the history of APIs.</p>

    <p>"The concept of an API pre-dates even the advent of personal computing,
    let alone the Web, by a very long time! The principal of a well documented
    set of publicly addressable "entry points" that allow an application to
    interact with another system has been an essential part of software
    development since the earliest days of utility data processing. However, the
    advent of distributed systems, and then the web itself, has seen the
    importance and utility of these same basic concepts increase dramatically."
    - Martin Bartlett</p>

    <p>When I talking about APIs, I'm focused one version that was born out of
    the enterprise, during the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) movement,
    which sometime around 2000, a portion of the SOA experiment left the
    enterprise and found a more fertile environment in the world of
    start-ups.</p>

    <p>Where we stand in 2016, there are some obvious technical reasons of why
    web APIs are finding success in companies of all shapes and sizes, and even
    within government; but not all the reasons for this success is technical.
    There are many other, less obvious aspects of web APis that have
    significantly contributed to their success, things we can only learn by
    closely studying the past and looking at why some of the pioneers of web
    APIs were successful.</p>

    <p>In 2016, we need to make sure we emulate the best practices that have
    been established over the last 13 years, and not ignore some of the critical
    variables that contribute to the success of early API providers like Amazon,
    Salesforce, Ebay and Twitter--much of what is still working in 2016.</p>

    <p>When we look back, we can begin see some clear patterns emerge that have
    defined the industry.  Patterns that need to be emulated, and some that
    should be avoided.</p>

  description: >-
    <p>As soon as the first .COM bubble burst, platforms were looking for
    innovative ways to syndicate products across e-commerce web sites, and web
    APIs, built on the backs of existing HTTP infrastructure proved to be the
    right tool for the job.</p>

    <p>With this in mind, a handful of  tech pioneers stepped up to define the
    earliest uses of APIs for sales and commerce management, kicking-off a ten
    year evolution that we can now call the early history of web APIs.</p>

    <p>However, even with the early success of APIs, they wouldn't reach
    maturity without several other critical ingredients that would prove as
    important as essential commerce variables like products, payments and sales.

    <p>February 7th, 2000 Salesforce.com officially launched at the IDG Demo
    2000 conference.</p>

    <p>Salesforce.com launched its enterprise-class, web-based, sales force
    automation as a "Internet as a service". XML APIs were part of
    Salesforce.com from day one. Salesforce.com identified that customers needed
    to share data across their different business applications, and APIs were
    the way to do this.</p>

    <p>Marc R. Benioff, chairman and founder of salesforce.com stated,
    "Salesforce.com is the first solution that truly leverages the Internet to
    offer the functionality of enterprise-class software at a mere fraction of
    the cost."</p>

    <p>Salesforce.com was the first cloud provider to take an enterprise class
    web application and API and deliver what we know today as
    Software-as-a-Service.</p>

    <p>Even with SalesForce being the first mover in the world of web APIs, they
    are still a powerhouse in 2016.  SalesForce continues to lead when it comes
    to real-time APIs, testing, deployment and most recently taking a lead when
    it comes to mobile application development and backend as a service
    (BaaS).</p>

  title: Ebay
  description: >-
    On November 20, 2000, eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface
    (API) , along with the eBay Developers Program.</p>

    <p>The eBay API was originally rolled out to only a select number of
    licensed eBay partners and developers.</p>

    <p>As eBay stated:</p>

    <blockquote>"Our new API has tremendous potential to revolutionize the way
    people do business on eBay and increase the amount of business transacted on
    the site, by openly providing the tools that developers need to create
    applications based on eBay technology, we believe eBay will eventually be
    tightly woven into many existing sites as well as future e-commerce
    ventures."</blockquote>

    The launch of the eBay API was a response to the growing number of
    applications that were already relying on its site either legitimately or
    illegitimately. The API aimed to standardize how applications integrated
    with eBay, and make it easier for partners and developers to build a
    business around the eBay ecosystem. eBay is considered the leading pioneer
    in the current era of web-based APIs and web services and still leads with
    one of the most successful developer ecosystem today.</p>

  description: >-
    <p>As API driven commerce platforms were still getting their footing, and
    understanding the best way to use APIs, a new breed of technology platforms
    emerged in the area content and messaging on the web in a way that was very
    user centric and socially enabling.</p>

    <p>Publishing user generated content, and the sharing of web links, photos
    and other media via APIs emerged with this birth of new social platforms
    between 2003 and 2006.  This was an entirely new era for APIs, one that
    wasn't about money, it was about connections.</p>

    <p>These new API driven, social platforms would take technology to new
    global heights, and ensure that applications from here forward, would all
    always contain essential social features, that were defined via their
    platform APIs. </p>

    <p>Social, was an essential ingredient the API industry was missing.</p>

  title: del.icio.us
  description: >-
    <p>del.icio.us is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing and
    discovering web bookmarks to web pages, that was founded by Jousha Schachter
    in 2003.</p>

    <p>Del.icio.us implemented a very simple tagging system which allowed users
    to easily tag their web bookmarks in a meaningful way, but also established
    a kind of folksonomy across all users of the platform. Which proved to be a
    pretty powerful way for cataloging and sharing web links.</p>

    <p>The innovative tagging methodology used by del.icio.us allowed you to
    pull a list of your tags, or public web bookmarks by using the URL
    http://del.icio.us/tag/[tag name]/. So if I was searching for bookmarks on
    airplanes, I could http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane and I would GET a list of
    all bookmarks that have been tagged airplane.  It was simple.</p>

    <p>When it came to the programmatic del.icio.us interface, the API was built
    into the site, creating a seamless experience--if you wanted the airplane
    tags via HTML you entered http://del.icio.us/tag/airplane, if you wanted RSS
    of the tags you entered http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/airplane, and if you
    wanted XML returned you used http://del.icio.us/api/tag/airplane. This has
    changed with the modern version of Delicious API.</p>

    <p>del.icio.us was the first, concrete example of how the web could deliver
    HTML content, alongside machine readable like RSS and XML, using a URL
    structure that was simple and human readable. This approach to sharing
    bookmarks would set the stage for future APIs, in making APIs easy to
    understand for developers and even non-developers alike. Any slightly
    technical user could easily parse the XML or RSS, and develop or reverse
    engineer widgets and apps around del.icio.us content.</p>

    <p>del.icio.us has been sold twice since its early popularity, which
    included to Yahoo! in 2005 and AVOS Systems on April, 2011. However
    del.icio.us was one of the pillar platforms that ushered in the social era
    of the API movement, establishing sharing via APIs as critical to the API
    economy, but also showing that simple rules when it comes to API design.</p>

  description: >-
    <p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site Flickr launched. Six
    months later they launched their now infamous API, and six months after
    that, they were acquired by Yahoo.</p>

    <p>Flickr was originally created as an online game, but quickly evolved into
    a social photo sharing sensation.</p>

    <p>The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image
    platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by
    allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and
    social network streams.</p>

    <p>The Flickr API is the driving inspiration behind the concept of BizDev
    2.0, a term coined by Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake.  Flickr couldn't keep
    up with the demand for its services, and established the API as a
    self-service way to deal with business development.</p>

    <p>The core concepts established by Flickr using its API would transcend the
    company and its acquisition by Yahoo.  Business development using APIs is
    embedded in the philosophy of the business of APIs pushing APIs to something
    beyond technical. </p>

    <p>APIs became something that any company could use to actually conduct
    business with its partners and the public, but we still had a ways to go
    before APIs would grow up.</p>

    <p>On August 15th 2006, Facebook launched its long-awaited development
    platform and API. Version 1.0 of the  Facebook Development Platform allowed
    developers access to Facebook friends, photos, events, and profile
    information for Facebook.</p>

    <p>The API used REST, and responses were available in an XML format,
    following common approaches by other social API providers of the time.

    <p>Almost immediately, developers began to build social applications, games,
    and mashups with the new development tools.</p>

    <p>The Facebook Development Platform gave Facebook an edge over then popular
    competitor MySpace, and established itself as the top social gaming platform
    with games like Farmville.</p>

    <p>While the Facebook API and platform is considered by many developers to
    be unstable, it continues to play a significant role in the evolution of the
    entire platform with applications and partnerships that drive new features
    and experiences on Facebook.</p>

    <p>On September 20, 2006 Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the
    world.</p>

    <p>Much like the release of the eBay API, Twitter's API release was in
    response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or
    creating rogue APIs.</p>

    <p>Twitter exposed the Twitter API via a REST interface using JSON and
    XML.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, Twitter used Basic Auth for API authentication,
    resulting the now infamous Twitter OAuth Apocalypse almost four years later,
    when Twitter forced all those using the API to switch to OAuth.</p>

    <p>In four short years Twitters API had become the center of countless
    desktop clients, mobile applications, web apps, and businesses -- even by
    Twitter itself, in its IPhone, IPad, Android apps via its public
    website.</p>

    <p>Twitter is one of the most important API platforms available, showing
    what is possible when a dead simple platform does one thing well, then opens
    up access via an API and lets an open API ecosystem build the rest.</p>

    <p>Twitter is also one of the most cautionary tales, of how your API
    ecosystem can also begin to work against you, unless you properly address
    the political considerations of an API ecosystem as it grows.</p>

    potential of APIs and common business practices. </p>

    <p>The establishment of common business  and marketing practices for the API

    <p>While writing about the history of APIs, it is easy to be so focused on
    just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire
    history of the web API--ProgrammableWeb.</p>

    <p>In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his
    original about page:</p>

    <p>ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering
    news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web
    2.0 APIs.</p>

    <blockquote>I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking
    for: a technology focused starting point for web platform development. (For
    a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I
    started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on
    the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with
    community input as well, this can be what we make it.<br />I hope you find
    the site useful.<br />John Musser - Seattle, August 2005</blockquote>

    <p>John’s original blog post on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:
    Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal.</p>

    <p>Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government,
    healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and
    resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society
    operates from here on forward.</p>

    <p>John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to
    deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    and Web Services, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before
    it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley.</p>

    <p>When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and
    started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was
    already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories that have
    told on ProgrammableWeb.</p>

    <p>As we progress through 2016, a year in which I think we can confidently
    say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success to
    ProgrammableWeb. The stories John, Adam and other writers have been telling
    on ProgrammableWeb have been crucial to quantifying and defining the API
    industry--allowing us all to build, iterate and move things forward.</p>

    <p>Without stories around the technical, business and politics of APIs,
    these virtual interfaces would not have been able to find a place in our
    real life worlds.</p>

    <p>In November 2006, API the first API service provider Mashery came out of
    "stealth mode" to offer documentation support, community management and
    access control for companies wishing to offer public or private APIs--from a
    blog post in TechCrunch titled API Management Service is Open for
    Business.</p>

    <p>At this point in time, in 2006, we were moving from the social period of
    APIs into the cloud computing phase with the introduction of Amazon Web
    Services. It was clear that the world of web APIs was getting real, and
    there was opportunity for companies to offer API management as a
    service.</p>

    <p>While there were tools for deploying APIs, there was no standard approach
    to managing your API deployment. Mashery was the first to bring a standard
    set of services to API providers, that would help set the stage for the
    future growth of the API industry.</p>

    <p>It would take almost six more years before the API industry would come of
    age, in which Mashery significantly helped contribute. The space we all know
    today was defined by early API commerce pioneers like SalesForce and Amazon,
    social pioneers like Flickr and Delicous, and from Mashery who helped define
    what is now know as the business of APIs.</p>

    <p>In 2016, Mashery was acquired by Intel, helping recently validate that
    the API industry truly has come of age. </p>

    <p>On June 29th, 2006, Google launched Google Maps API allowing developers
    to put Google Maps on their own sites using JavaScript.</p>

    <p>The API launch was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps
    as an application, and was in direct response to the number of rogue
    applications developed that were hacking the application. Google Maps was
    immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and
    developed application such as housingmaps.com and chicagocime.org. The
    demand was so great for information on hacking Google Maps it spawned books
    such as Mapping Hacks and Google Hacks from O'Reilly.</p>

    <p>Google Maps API started a trend of API mashups with its valuable location
    based data, with over 2000 mashups to date.</p>

    <p>The API demonstrates the incredible value of geographic data and mapping
    APIs, as well as the power users can have in influencing the direction an
    application or API takes. Lars Rasmussen, the original developer of Google
    Maps commented how much he learned from the developer community by watching
    how they hacked the application in real-time, and they took what they
    learned and applied it to the API we know today.</p>

    <p>Few other companies have the resources to tackle a problem like mapping
    the worlds resources and delivering a reusable, API driven resource, like
    Google did.  Google has played many roles in moving forward the APi space,
    but Google Maps played a pivotal role in the history of APIs.</p>

    <p>In March, 2006 Amazon launched a new web service, something completely
    different from the Amazon bookseller and e-commerce site we've come to know.
    This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called Amazon
    S3.</p>

    <p>Amazon S3 provides a simple interface that can be used to store and
    retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives
    developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive
    data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network
    of websites.</p>

    <p>Amazon S3 or Simple Storage Service was initially just an API. There was
    no Web interface or mobile app. It was just a RESTful API allowing PUT and
    GET requests with objects or files.</p>

    <p>Developers using the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 a gigabyte per
    month for storing files in the cloud.</p>

    <p>With this new type of API and billing model, Amazon ushered in a new type
    of computing we now know as cloud computing.</p>

    <p>This also meant that APIs were no longer just for data or simple
    functionality. Now they could be used to deliver computing
    infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API.
    Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.</p>

    <p>Using the Amazon EC2 API developers can launch small, large and extra
    large servers and pay for every hour that the server is running.</p>

    <p>Amazon EC2, combined with Amazon S3 has provided the platform for the

    <p>APIs make valuable resources modular, portable and distributed, making
    them a perfect channel for developing mobile and table applications of all
    shapes and sizes.</p>

    <p>A small group of API driven technology platforms have helped defined the
    space and won over the hearts and minds of both developers and the end users
    of the applications they develop.</p>

    <p>In March 2009 Foursquare launched at the SXSW interactive festival in
    Austin, TX.</p>

    <p>Foursquare is a location-based mobile platform that makes cities more
    interesting to explore, by checking in via a smartphone app or SMS, users
    share their location with friends while collecting points and virtual
    badges.</p>

    <p>In November 2009 after a round of angel funding from several investors
    including Union Square Ventures and O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, Foursquare
    launch their API.</p>

    <p>At the time of API launch, Foursquare had an impressive set of
    applications developed by a closed group of partners including anAndroid
    application and augmented reality with Layar.</p>

    <p>Even with growing competition from early mover Gowalla and major players
    like Facebook and Google, Foursquare has emerged as the dominant mobile
    location-sharing and check-in platforms.</p>

  description: >-
    <p>On October 6, 2010 Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone
    application.</p>

    <p>Less than three months later, it had one million users. Kevin Systrom the
    founder of Instagram focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app
    that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users'
    frustrations with sharing. Immediately many users complained about the lack
    of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on
    focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.</p>

    <p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to
    reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own unofficial
    Instagram API. By January Instagram shut down the rogue API and announced it
    was building one of its own. Then in February of 2011, Instagram released
    the official API for the photo platform. Within days many photo
    applications, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started
    showing up. Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly
    needed an API to realize its full potential.  Asserting the platforms place
    in history as one of the defining players in the mobile period of APis.</p>

  title: Twilio
  description: >-
    <p>In 2007, a new API-as-a-product platform launched, called Twilio, which
    introduced a voice API allowing developers to make and receive phone calls
    via any cloud application. Over the last 3 years Twilio has additionally
    released a text messaging and SMS short code API, making itself a critical
    telephony resource in many developers toolbox.</p>

    <p>Twilio is held up as a model platform to follow when evangelizing to
    developers. Twilio has helped define which technical and business building
    blocks are essential for a healthy API driven platform, set the bar for on
    the ground evangelism at events and hackathons, and worked hard to showcase,
    support and invest it its developer ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Alongside Foursquare and Instagram, Twilio has come to define mobile
    application development, helping push APIs into the mainstream. While
    Twitter has sometime been held up as a cautionary tale when it comes to
    APIs,  Twilio has demonstrated, that when done right, API driven ecosystems
    do work.</p>

    <p>By 2011 the bar for delivering APIs, via HTTP, has been well established
    by early pioneers like SalesForce and Amazon, but Twilio has shown how
    mature the business of APIs has become with its evolution into the mobile
    period.  However, mobile development via APIs, owes its roots to the
    foundation laid by the commerce, social and cloud API pioneers.</p>

  title: Understanding Our API History
  description: >-
    <p>Understanding history is critical to understanding where we are going.
    Calling this document the "history" of web APIs seems kind of silly. We are
    actually talking about a span of 13 years. But there are so many important
    lessons to be learned from the approach of these API pioneers, we can't
    ignore this history. If the technologists had their way, APIs would have
    purely been successful in the period of commerce, but with the radical
    innovation of companies like Amazon, Twitter and Twilio, we now understand
    that APIs needed several essential ingredients to succeed: commerce, social,
    cloud and mobile.</p>

    <p>Of course, all of this has to make money, but APIs need to be scalable,
    while also delivering the meaningful tools, services and resources that are
    important end users, otherwise none of this matters. As we stand solidly in
    the mobile period of API evolution, looking at the evolution to a period
    that will be more about devices and an internet of things (IOT), we need to
    understand our own history and how we've gotten here, to make sure we the
    right decisions for what is next.</p>

    <p>Web APIs are about delivering valuable, meaningful, scalable and
    distributed resources across the World Wide Web. While Silicon Valley keep
    pushing forward with the next generation of technology solutions, we need to
    make sure that we know our past.</p>
